## EXPERIMENTAL 1 FOR VERSION 2.0
Since DBM is still using DiscordJS V12 there are still limitation on things that i can add into
DBM Embed Builder, the current version you're going to install is fully functional for the current
DBM Version you're using.

Once DBM Updated DiscordJS V13 (Discord Bot Maker V1.7 Update), i'll add more features into
DBM Embed Builder.
